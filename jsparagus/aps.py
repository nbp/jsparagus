    # An APS does not exclusively start at the parser entry point, but starts
    # from any state of the parse table by calling `APS.start`. Then we walk
    # the parse table forward, as-if we were shifting tokens or epsilon edges
    # in the parse table. The function `aps.shift_next(parse_table)` will
    # explore all possible futures reachable from the starting point.
    #
    # As the parse table is explored, new APS are produced by
    # `aps.shift_next(parse_table)`, which are containing the new state of the
    # parser and the history which has been seen by the APS since it started.

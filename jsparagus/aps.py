# An edge in a Parse table is a tuple of a source state and the term followed

# inferred by looking it up in the parse table.
#
# Note, the term might be `None` if no term is specified yet. This is useful
# when manipulating a list of edges and we know that we are taking transitions
# from a given state, but not yet with which term.
#
#   state: Index of the state from which this directed edge is coming from.
#
#   term: Edge transition value, this can be a terminal, non-terminal or an
#       action to be executed on an epsilon transition.

class APS:
    # To fix inconsistencies of the grammar, we have to traverse the grammar
    # both forward by using the lookahead and backward by using the state
    # recovered from following unwind actions.
    #
    # To do so we define the notion of abstract parser state (APS), which is a
    # class which represents the known state of the parser, relative to its
    # starting point.
    #
    # An APS does not exclusively start at the parser entry point, but starts
    # from any state of the parse table by calling `APS.start`. Then we walk
    # the parse table forward, as-if we were shifting tokens or epsilon edges
    # in the parse table. The function `aps.shift_next(parse_table)` will
    # explore all possible futures reachable from the starting point.
    #
    # As the parse table is explored, new APS are produced by
    # `aps.shift_next(parse_table)`, which are containing the new state of the
    # parser and the history which has been seen by the APS since it started.
    #
    #   stack: This is the known stack at the location where we started
    #          investigating. As more history is discovered by resolving unwind
    #          actions, this stack would be filled with the predecessors which
    #          have been visited before reaching the starting state.
    #
    #   shift: This is the stack as manipulated by an LR parser. States are
    #          shifted to it, including actions, and popped from it when
    #          visiting a unwind action.
    #
    #   lookahead: This is the list of terminals and non-terminals encountered
    #          by shifting edges which are not replying tokens.
    #
    #   replay: This is the list of lookahead terminals and non-terminals which
    #          remains to be shifted. This list corresponds to terminals and
    #          non-terminals which were necessary for removing inconsistencies,
    #          but have to be replayed after shifting the reduced
    #          non-terminals.
    #
    #   reducing: This is a boolean flag which is used to distinguish whether
    #          the next term to be replayed is the result of a Reduce action or
    #          not. When reducing, epsilon transitions should be ignored. This
    #          flag is useful to implement Unwind and Reduce as 2 different
    #          actions.
    #
    #   history: This is the list of edges visited since the starting state.
